This is an excellent work of archival history covering the history of the HP South Queensferry site, where my Grandpa worked!.

The work is split into three volumes: From the site *"Volume 1 covers the full 50 year story, Volume 2 the technology developed, and the final volume is a illustrated colour photo book"*.
